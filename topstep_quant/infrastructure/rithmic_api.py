"""Rithmic API Broker implementation.

This is a placeholder implementation for Rithmic's API. Rithmic provides a proprietary API (R|API) typically accessed
through their R|Trader platform or SDK. This class outlines how one might integrate with Rithmic, but the actual
function calls would depend on the Rithmic API library (not available in this context).
